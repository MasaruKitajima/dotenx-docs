`Projects` are the simply the way you organize and isolate your applications.

When you create a project a database is created and allocated specifically to your project. This database is later used to store all the data in your project,
mainly the users' information, and the database tables.

In order to create a project, simply click on the `+` button, give the project a name and optionally a description.
Once your project is created, you can click on the project to navigate to the Builder studio where you build your application.
